## :à¼— About the 90-90 Challenge à¼—:

The 90-90 challenge is a personal development challenge where the goal is to dedicate 90 days to learning and mastering a specific skill or subject. It involves consistent practice and improvement over the course of 90 days. The challenge aims to foster discipline, dedication, and skill development within a specific timeframe.

## :à¼— Importance of Positivity and Consistent Practice à¼—:

The 90-90 challenge emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and consistent practice. It encourages individuals to stay focused, dedicated, and open to learning throughout the entire duration of the challenge. This approach can be particularly beneficial in fields such as coding, where continuous practice and a positive attitude are essential for skill development and improvement.

## :à¼— Personal Growth and Skill Development à¼—:

Participating in the 90-90 challenge can lead to significant personal growth and skill development. By consistently practicing coding or participating in coding contests on various platforms, individuals can enhance their problem-solving abilities, logical thinking, and coding proficiency. This can be especially beneficial for individuals in the early stages of their coding journey, as it provides a structured approach to skill enhancement.

##  :à¼— Challenge Description à¼—:
The challenge involves dedicating the first 100 days to solving problems on different platforms, participating in coding contests, and continuously improving coding skills. The subsequent 100 days allow for independent continuation of the learning process, thereby fostering self-reliance and further skill development.


## :à¼—Tasksà¼—:

First of all, not take it as tasks or assignment, I am giving you a brief why these tasks are needed?

C++ and Java both are popular languages to learn and practice DSA. Let's do something different. 
Try to learn DSA in more than one language. But, go with this, only when you adopt the habit of coding.


## :à¼— Task 1 à¼—:
First task is to select another programming language along with your current programming language and try to submit your POTD solutions using these two languages every day.  

## :à¼— Task 2 à¼—:  
Share your success stories with your near and dears. 
If you like this repo then also give a star at the end, I want to know if this repo is really helping you or not.(Optional)

All the best everyone!
