# Welcome 2024 ðŸŽ‰
When a new year begins, we welcome it with all our positive energy.
But this time let's start with something else, what is that? 
## Consistency


# Congratulations on maintaining 13 days of consistency with me ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜ƒ. Let's continue and complete it for the remaining 97 days.


Long coding challenges are much like test matches in cricket.

Even if we lose, we will gain something, Consistency.

# About the 90-90 Challenge

The 90-90 challenge is a personal development challenge where the goal is to dedicate 90 days to learning and mastering a specific skill or subject. It involves consistent practice and improvement over the course of 90 days. The challenge aims to foster discipline, dedication, and skill development within a specific timeframe.

### Importance of Positivity and Consistent Practice
The 90-90 challenge emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and consistent practice. It encourages individuals to stay focused, dedicated, and open to learning throughout the entire duration of the challenge. This approach can be particularly beneficial in fields such as coding, where continuous practice and a positive attitude are essential for skill development and improvement.

### Personal Growth and Skill Development
Participating in the 90-90 challenge can lead to significant personal growth and skill development. By consistently practicing coding or participating in coding contests on various platforms, individuals can enhance their problem-solving abilities, logical thinking, and coding proficiency. This can be especially beneficial for individuals in the early stages of their coding journey, as it provides a structured approach to skill enhancement.

### Challenge Description
The challenge involves dedicating the first 100 days to solving problems on different platforms, participating in coding contests, and continuously improving coding skills. The subsequent 100 days allow for independent continuation of the learning process, thereby fostering self-reliance and further skill development.

### Encouragement to Stay Positive and Committed
It's important to maintain a positive outlook and commitment throughout the 100-day challenge. By focusing on personal growth, skill enhancement, and consistent practice, individuals can derive maximum benefit from the challenge and significantly improve their coding abilities.

Remember, the 90-90 challenge is designed to foster personal and professional development through dedicated practice and a positive mindset. Good luck with your coding journey and the completion of the challenge!


# Good morning, 
I hope everyone is doing well. Today, our 90-90 challenge will be completed it's 7 days, but at this point, I feel the need to write something for you. First of all, I want to say that taking on this 90-90 challenge is not just a decision, it's a part of my learning. There comes a time when I feel that it's essential to share the start of my learning journey with everyone for the first 7 days, after seeing some reactions.

The thought of not being able to do something on my own in the engineering field should not cross one's mind. There are elders, siblings, Sir, and Ma'am around, but it's important for us to be a little self-reliant. By self-reliant, I mean making an effort first, being with God or any positive energy, and if you find a way, go straight, if not, seek help.

Now, the 7 days have passed, and it's time for you to be with me in this challenge without any kind of negative feelings (fear, anger, hatred), and complete this challenge with utmost positivity. Especially for my younger siblings in the 1st and 2nd years, who are not yet clear about coding, and for the 3rd or 4th-year siblings, who still struggle to grasp coding properly. I haven't taught you anything, I've just consistently practiced with you. Because this is our job, always improving.

Otherwise, I will keep this task private.
