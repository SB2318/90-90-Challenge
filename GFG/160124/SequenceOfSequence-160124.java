/**
   Intuition: Mind it these four condition.
    (i) You can take any value up to M means if your current sequence element is x, then x âˆˆ [1,m]
    (ii) seqi+1 >= 2*seqi 
    (iii) seqi > 0
     (iv) seqi <= m

   Now, the approach is in the function try to follow the bottom-up and take-skip approach and try to fill the List of sequences from
    last, 
   First include M in your sequence, find the remaining sequence from [1, m/2], and reduce the length to n-1 as you already select one 
   element.  why m/2? because seqi+1 >= 2*seqi , i.e. semi < seqi+1/2

   Skip M, means not include m in your current sequence, now try to explore the number of sequences out of  [1,m-1] elements with
    fixed length n.

     if (m == 0) {
            return 0;  // we can't consider empty sequence here, n might not be 0, the case already covered.
     }
